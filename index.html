    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into
        the bowl and mix until combined.
      </li>
      <li>In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla.</li>
      <li>
        With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry.
        <br />With mixer still on low, add the coffee and stir just to combine,
        scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into two 8-inch round prepared pans and bake for 30 to
        40 minutes at 350Â°F, until a cake tester or toothpick comes out mostly
        clean (not wet)
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling
        rack and cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
